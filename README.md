# Sparks_Foundation
As part of my internship at sparks foundation I completed following tasks:

### 1.) Predictions using Supervised ML
* Predicting the percentage of student based on number of study hours.
* This was a simple **Linear Regression** problem task as it invloves only 2 variables.

### 2.) Prediction using Unsupervised ML
* From the give **Iris** dataset, predicting the optimum number of clusters and representing them visually.
* Used KMeans algorithm for clustering the dataset.
* Also used **PCA** algorithm for reduing the dataset from 4 dimensions to 2 dimensions and the using scatterplot to visualise the distribution of each categories.

### 3.) Exploratory Data Analysis on Super Store data
* Performed exploratory data analysis on a superstore data to find the weak areas where store is making less profits so that the owner can focus more on those areas in order to increase profit.
* Used **Peaeson's Correlation** and **ANOVA** test for finding the correlation among the features.
* Used Shapiro Wilk's test to check the normality of distribution.
* Used **cube root** and **YeoJohnsons** transformation techniques for transforming the profit fetature to normal distribution.
